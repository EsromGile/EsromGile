## About Me
I hold a degree in Software Engineering with a minor in Mathematics from the University of Central Oklahoma, where I also supported students as a Mathematics Tutor for over three years. I really enjoy working on new projects and finding ways to improve my existing skillset. Continual learning and creating is a large part of my life purpose and goals.
